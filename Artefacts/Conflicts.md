# Conflicts and Resolutions

## Conflict 1
**Property Owner:**  
I want my property to be shown to most users.  

**Tenant:**  
I want the properties to come as per my preferences.  

## Similar Conflict

**Property Owner:**  
I want a tenant according to my preference.  

**Tenant:**  
I want the property I want easily.

**Resolution:**  
We want the app to have maximum benefits for everyone, so it is better to suggest according to preference.

## Conflict 2
**Tenant:**  
I want the response from the property owner quickly.  

**Property Owner:**  
I will take my time to respond to the tenant.  

**Resolution:**  
The property would go down the list if the property owner does not respond.

## Conflict 3

**Property Owner**
I want to list my property even if it is half occupied

**Tenant**
Since I need to live with the roommate, I will list the property

**Both want to list the same property**

**Resolution**
Legally, the property owner must allow who lives in their property, so we let both of them list the property. We are just a matching application, and for both the tenant and the property owner, we would provide the best fit. And what happens after that is out of our scope
