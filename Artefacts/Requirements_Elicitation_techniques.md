## ðŸ“Œ Requirements Elicitation Techniques

## 1. Interview  
**Stakeholder:** Property Owner  

We need to gather details and understand the requirements and needs of property owners so we can implement them in our app. Therefore, we chose this technique because it allows one-on-one interaction with property owners, which helps us understand their challenges, clarify doubts, and explore hidden requirements.

## 2. Survey  
**Stakeholder:** Tenant  

We conducted surveys with tenants to collect opinions from a large number of users efficiently. This technique helps identify the challenges they face while finding flats, as well as common preferences, such as facilities and search filters. This data, gathered through surveys, enables us to prioritize features that meet the needs of the majority of tenants.

## 3. Documentation  
**Stakeholder:** Software Engineer  

By reviewing existing rental apps, we can better understand how things work and pinpoint any gaps or features that might be missing. This background study gives us a solid starting point, helping us stay in line with industry standards and helping us not make the same mistakes that have been made in the past.

## 4. Brainstorming  
**Stakeholder:** Software Engineer  

Our process starts by gathering ideas from the team without judgment, ensuring every voice is heard. We categorize these ideas into functional requirements, which outline what the product should do and non-functional requirements, which focus on quality and performance constraints.

Next, we analyze each idea through open discussions to assess strengths, weaknesses, dependencies, and potential challenges. This insight allows us to prioritize the ideas that align with our product goals and user needs, ensuring thorough and realistic final requirements.
