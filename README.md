# Stay Pal: FlatMate Finder

**Stay Pal** is a modern web platform designed to help users find compatible flatmates, making the process of sharing a home safer and more efficient. The platform connects tenants with like-minded individuals and allows landlords to list their properties — all within a secure and verified environment.  
Our goal is to eliminate the uncertainty and risk associated with finding a flatmate.
