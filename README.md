Stay Pal: FlatMate Finder

Stay Pal is a modern web platform designed to help users find compatible flatmates, making the process of sharing a home safer and more efficient. The platform connects tenants with like-minded individuals and allows landlords to list their properties, all within a secure and verified environment. Our goal is to eliminate the uncertainty and risk associated with finding a flatmate.

3.Development Workflow

Our team follows the Scrum framework, an Agile methodology that allows us to develop iteratively and incrementally.

Current Sprint: Sprint 1

Our first sprint, running from September 21st to September 28th, is focused on building the foundational elements of the application. The primary goals are to set up the database, implement user authentication (signup/login), and create the initial landing page and user profile structure. For a detailed breakdown of tasks and day-to-day progress, please refer to our [Sprints](https://github.com/Krish-Makwana-1205/Stay_Pal/blob/main/Artefacts/Sprints.md) file.
